          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
          physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
          at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
          venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
          particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
          discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
          potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could
          have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
          repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
          of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
        </p>
        <p>
          If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
          heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped
          mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
          irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
          diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.

          In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
          operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
          accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
          Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of
          gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
          general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
          expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as
          it gets.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
          sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath
          of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture
          of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the
          surface of the sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
          Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization,
          reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
          Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The
          Astrophysical Journal.

          <label>The Theory of Inflation</label>
          <p>
            Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of
            inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly
            and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion
            years ago.

            <p>
              <span>THE UNIVERSE</span>&nbsp; is just under 14 billion years
              old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a
              sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But
              there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even
              temperature.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="item">

            <p>
              <span>NOT ENOUGH TIME</span>&nbsp; The universe is not old
              enough for light to have traveled the vast distance from one
              side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough
              time for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even
              temperature.

            <p>
              <span>DISTANT COFFEE</span>&nbsp; At a smaller scale, imagine
              using a telescope to look a mile in one direction. You see a
              coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its
              temperature and how much it has cooled.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</span>&nbsp; Now turn around and look a
              mile in the other direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at
              exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see
              a similar cup in every direction, you might want to look for
              another explanation.

            <p>
              <span>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</span>&nbsp; There has not been
              enough time to carry coffee cups from place to place before they
              get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a
              single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain
              their even temperature.

            <p>
              <span>INFLATION</span>&nbsp; solves this problem. The theory
              proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after the Big
              Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny
              ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew
              into the large-scale structures of the universe

          <div class="item">

            <p>
              <span>FLUCTUATION</span>&nbsp; Astronomers have now detected
              evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized
              light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left
              over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves
              predicted by Einstein.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="item">
            <img src="./img/expansion.JPG" alt="" />
            <p>
              <span>EXPANSION</span>&nbsp; Returning to our coffee, imagine a
              single, central pot expanding faster than light and cooling to
              an even temperature as it expands. That is something like
              inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth
              and foam of the original pot.

          Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described

            The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to detect the
            faint spiraling gravity patterns — the <br />
            signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart at its
            birth. <span>Steffen Richter/Associated Press</span>

          In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave
          radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight
          preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.

        <p>
          This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the
          gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in
          one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would
          twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists
          said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have
          little arrows going in spirals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small
          differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s
          telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.

          “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said. The
          strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a
          year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they
          had things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to
          the breakthrough.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists
          like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago,
          suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the
          universe.
