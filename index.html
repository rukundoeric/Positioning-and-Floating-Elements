          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
          physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
          at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
          venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
          particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
          discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
          potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could
          have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
          repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
          of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
        </p>
        <p>
          If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
          heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped
          mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
          irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
          diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
          “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page
          and drew a double box around it.
        </p>

          On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#" class="p-links">the first sliver of cosmic time </a>with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="#" class="p-links">gravitational waves </a>— the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

        </div>
        <p>
          Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
        </p>
        <p>
        If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
        </p>
        <p>
      Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.

          In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
          operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
          accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
          Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of
          gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
          general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
          expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as
          it gets.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
          sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath
          of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture
          of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the
          surface of the sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
          Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization,
          reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
          Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The
          Astrophysical Journal.

          “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was
          a delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything, but I
          simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde
          wrote in an email.

        <p>
          Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he
          was still hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way
          of spoiling a vacation,” he said.

          By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that
          inflation had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded
          with a mixture of jubilation and caution.

          “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on
          the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said,
          wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.

            The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to detect the
            faint spiraling gravity patterns — the <br />

            birth. <span>Steffen Richter/Associated Press</span>

          In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave
          radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight
          preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the
          gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in
          one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would
          twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists
          said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have
          little arrows going in spirals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small
          differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s
          telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.
        </p>
        <p>
          “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said. The
          strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a
          year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they
          had things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to
          the breakthrough.

          The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists
          like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago,
          suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the
          universe.
